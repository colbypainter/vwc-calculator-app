VWC Calculator Application

The first thing I ever made.
A set of JS benefit calculators I developed as an SA for the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission. I used this as an opportunity to build out requirements and pick up some development skills. 

This is just a DEMO version, it is not in any way official product of VWC. For the real version, see <a href="http://calculators.workcomp.virginia.gov/Calculators/index.html">here</a>.
